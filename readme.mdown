Learn more about Scrivito at [scrivito.com](https://www.scrivito.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=natural&utm_campaign=github_example_app).

This example app shows Scrivito‚Äôs features and is a great basis for your own Scrivito website projects.

## Features

Scrivito is a SaaS Content Management Service, built for digital agencies and medium to large sized businesses.

It is the only CMS that combines unmatched WYSIWYG usability for editors with maximum flexibility for developers ‚Äì because it is at the forefront of the current [JavaScript web development revolution](https://www.webdevelopmentrevolution.com/).

And because Scrivito is 100% serverless, you'll never have to patch your CMS, so it's the most secure and cost-effective solution on the market.

## Getting Started

Sign up for a free trial at [my.scrivito.com/signup](https://my.scrivito.com/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=github_example_app).

Now that you do have a Scrivito tenant, it's time to do some development.

### Clone repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Scrivito/scrivito_example_app_js.git
cd scrivito_example_app_js/
```

### Install/check prerequisites

Make sure that you have [![node ‚â• 8.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/node-‚â•%208.0-blue.svg)](https://nodejs.org) and [![npm ‚â• 5.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-‚â•%205.0-blue.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

```
node -v
# should output something like v8.9.4

npm -v
# should output something like 5.6.0
```

### Install dependencies

Now simply call `npm install` in the commandline to install all js dependencies (which are places in the folder `node_modules/`).

### Specify the Scrivito CMS to use

The Scrivito example app JS requires the tenant ID of your CMS. The ID is read from the environment variable `SCRIVITO_TENANT`. The environment variable can also be set via [`.env`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).

To specify it, proceed as follows:

* Go to your [Scrivito websites](https://my.scrivito.com/tenants/).
* Click the CMS to use.
* Open the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù tab.
* Scroll down to the ‚ÄúAPI Keys‚Äù section.
* Copy the value after SCRIVITO_TENANT= to the clipboard.
* In the project directory, open/create the file `.env` and paste the ID after the `SCRIVITO_TENANT` key. The file should then look like this:

```
SCRIVITO_TENANT=0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF
```

See `.env.example` for an concrete example.

### Set the authorized URLs

To enable resource sharing between your CMS and your web application, specify the URL of your app in the CMS settings.

* Like above, navigate to the ‚ÄúDeployment‚Äù tab of the CMS to use with your app.
* Make sure, that `http://localhost:8080` is added to the "Other authorized URLs".

## How to build/compile

Calling `npm run build` will compile all js, html and css and place it in the `build/` folder. It also creates a `build.zip` file, which can be deployed via [my.scrivito.com](https://my.scrivito.com).

## How to develop

Calling `npm start` will start a webserver, which listens to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and opens that site in your browser. It should also automatically reload the page, once changes to the code (in `src/`) have been made.

## Your first change

To see development in action, let's change the `ButtonWidget`, so that it prefixes all buttons with your favorite emoji.

Open up the react component responsible to render a `ButtonWidget`. It's located at `src/Widgets/ButtonWidget/ButtonWidgetComponent.js`. Now look for the `Scrivito.LinkTag`. Inside add a `{ 'üöÄ ' }` prior to `{ text }`.

Once you save the file your browser should automatically reload [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with your new emoji button. Of cause you can choose another emoji, e.g. by searching [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org).

Have fun!
